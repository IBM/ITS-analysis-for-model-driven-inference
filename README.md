# ITS-analysis-for-model-driven-inference

Repository with the interrupted time series code based on prophet and Poisson regression.

This OSS project is aimed to provide codebase that allows a user to use two different Interrupted Time Series models sequentially. The codebase provides a generic source code that allows model driven inference for any generic model.

This projects allows a user to use their data in a specified format to perform interrupted time series, get summaries of their data via plots & metrics.
